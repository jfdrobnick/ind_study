These files were created during a Xilinx workshop intended to introduce 
the Ultra96 and workflow using Vivado and XSDK.

Goals: Create simple block diagram, test it. 

Files needed available from git: 
	https://github.com/ATaylorCEngFIET/Hello_Ultra96

A recording of the workshop can be found on YouTube here:

Block diagram files (.bd) can be opened in Vivado by double clicking.
The image can be popped out to see a larger display. Double clicking on 
any of the boxes in the diagram will bring up a lower level view of the 
object. Configuration of hardware such as multiplexed I/O can be done here. A "C" in the name means they are coherent to some extent.

PS-PL configuration: Enable/disable interrupts, generate fabric resets
		     (associate with clocks)
